Quarto
Quarto
enables
you
to
weave
together
content
and
executable
code
into
a
finished
document.

To
create
the
release
cycle
in
your
repo
you
may
want
to
use
Conventional
Commits.
Conventional
Commits
are
a
way
to
format
and
standardize
your
commit
messages,
which
can
be
used
to
then
automate
the
repoâ€™s
release
cycle.
For
example,
one
conventional
naming
method
is
to
label
any
commit
associated
with
a
new
feature
as
plus
a
commit
message.
The
word
can
trigger
a
Github
Action
to
add
that
commit
to
your
changelog
under
the
Features
header,
and
it
will
up-version
the
minor
release
version
number.
So
if
you
are
on
release
1.0.0,
a
new
will
up-version
the
cycle
to
1.1.0
Commit
titles
that
start
with
the
word
as
in
a
bug
fix
will
up-version
the
patch
number
of
the,
i.e.Â 1.0.0
to
1.0.1
Automating
The
Release
Cycle
You
should
consider
automating
your
release
cycle
so
that
your
project
cycle
is
consistent
and
predictable.
There
are
many
different
ways
to
approach
this.
Some
repos
have
semi-automatic
cycles
where
there
is
some
manual
component
of
releasing
their
software,
whereas
others
are
fully
automated.
Manual
releases
can
work
too
for
some
scenarios.
